# Instructions for People page

The [people.js](../js/people.js) file currently contains the code for adding lab members to the page.

1. __Part 1: UPDATING the list of lab members__

  1. The instructions for this part are very similar to the __PART 1__ instructions in [publications.md](publications.md). The corresponding Google Spreadsheet file is "VKC Lab People (Web)".

  2. *__Note that it is CRUCIAL for the first line to match the keys specified in the people.js file.__*

  3. Please check that each member's image file matches the one specified in the spreadsheet, e.g. that someone named Hattie Alexander who has "people_hattie.jpg" listed under the Photo column does have an image located at _img/people/people_hattie.jpg_ .

  4. Images should be square but may be of any size (recommended 600x600 px).

2. __Part 2: CHANGING the type of info listed about lab members__

  1. The instructions for this part are very similar to the __PART 2__ instructions in [publications.md](publications.md). The corresponding JavaScript file is _people.js_ .
